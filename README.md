# MinSnake

### Purpose

MinSnake is a small, lightweight implementation of the classic game Snake. It is written
in C++ and made for Windows. I created it to return to small game projects as well as to
learn how to make and finish a full game from scratch in C++. 

The game has a minimalistic artstyle and mechanics, but has 40 levels to play, giving it 
a playtime of around an hour. It was fun putting some thought into how just tweaking a 
basic layout of walls and some stage goal parameters could lead to enough variety to be 
entertaining.

### Compile

Open the VS project in the repository in Visual Studio C++. Then build the project in the
standard way that C++ projects are compiled in Visual Studio C++.

### Dependencies

MinSnake utilizes the C++ standard library and SDL2 2.28.4.
